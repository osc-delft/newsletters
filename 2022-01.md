**Announcements**
- Many thanks to all of you who contributed feedback to the **National Plan Open Science Ambition Document 2030**! You can find here [an abridged version of TUD's official response](https://openworking.wordpress.com/2022/01/03/response-from-tu-delft-on-national-programme-open-science-consultation-document/) and the [Dutch Open Science Communities' collective response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B4XGJQQSGwvGy1LzevB6n2nUoHiB2qDz/edit).

Some personal news: I'll be leaving TU Delft at the end of January to take up a new role at [Invest in Open Infrastructure](https://investinopen.org). I've really enjoyed getting to know some of you and working with this community - I'd love to stay in touch! You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emmy_ft) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmy-tsang-phd-11aa793b/).

We're looking to recruit someone into the role ASAP, but there will likely be a break in this community's activities. If you are interested in coordinating this community in the mean time, please do let me know - it's a good opportunity to get some hands-on experience in running scientific communities :)

*Are there announcements, events and opportunities that you would like to bring to the community for the next newsletter? Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/osc-delft/newsletters/issues) or email me.*

Best,
