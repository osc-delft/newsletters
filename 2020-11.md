Dear OSC Delft members,

First, some housekeeping (yet important) issues:
* Because of the community's decision to rebrand to Open Science Community Delft and become part of the International Network of Open Science and Scholarhip Communities (INOSC), we are automatically committed to adopt a [new Code of Conduct](https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (in addition to the TU Delft Code of Conduct, which all employees abide by). *If you have any questions/concerns about this Code of Conduct and its implementation, please let me know via email (email removed) by November 30, 2020; after this date. If there are no concerns expressed by this date, we will assume that all existing members agree to abide by this new Code while engaging in community-related activities, and will adopt it officially.* 
* [Our newsletters are now viewable online](https://github.com/osc-delft/newsletters)! The aim is to make our communications more open, and also to allow prospective members to see what they are signing up for. 
* As we move beyond Data Champions towards a broader open science community, your ideas and input will be crucial - please reach out to me if you have ideas, or just want a chat. I'd love to listen, brainstorm and get to know you all (:

**Announcements**
* Joost de Winter (Data champion, 3mE) has written [this article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344873188_Open_science_Waarom_zou_je_het_doen) to share his experience and views on adopting open science practices and the associated challenges. 
* Thank you to everyone who contributed to our community website development - you've moved us ever so close to having an online home where everyone can contribute :house: If you would like to help get us to v1, please visit [this issues page](https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/issues) to see what still needs to be done


**Opportunities**
* TU Delft OPEN Publishing has *the Evolving Scholar* - an open acess plaform for multidisciplinary, open peer-reviewed publications. [Visit the Evolving Scholar website](https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/thes/) to find out how you can submit your research and get open feedback, help review/moderate and contribute to open research communication! 
* IEEE Software is now calling for submissions for a Special Issue on Collaborative Aspects of Open Data in Software Engineering - Submissions due May 7, 2021. Read more about [the special issue](https://www.computer.org/digital-library/magazines/so/call-for-papers-special-issue-on-collaborative-aspects-of-open-data-in-software-engineering/ ).
* Over 250 TU Delft researchers have chosen to make more of their research output openly available- and it only takes one minute?! [Participate today](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/library-voor-onderzoekers/library-voor-onderzoekers/publiceren-verspreiden/you-share-we-take-care/).
* Are you passionate about open source and would you like to help 4TU.ResearchData develop tools & infrastructure to help researchers share their research results? [Have a look at this job opportunity](https://www.academictransfer.com/en/295185/developer-of-open-science-data-infrastructures/)
* During the COVID-19 pandemic, perceptions and trustworthiness of science have been severely tested. Researchers from Cambridge University and TU Delft have developed a short, anonymous survey on perceptions of access and trust in relation to COVID-19 Open Data sources within research communities. [Share your experience in less than 3 minutes!](https://cambridge.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_094DWDvWZ3wpkax)
* Do you know someone who has made efforts to promote Open Science with their peers and in their local communities? [Nominate them for the Open Initiatives Trophy](https://opensciencefestival.nl/call-for-the-open-initiatives-trophy/) - the winners will be announced at the Open Science Festival on February 2021.
