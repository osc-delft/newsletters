Dear OSC Delft members, 

*What are some questions and concerns regarding practicing open science that you have had, or your colleagues have asked?* Please [let us know](https://forms.gle/vzhVEVZcmzubAzvW7) to help design the new TUD open science website!

In the last two months, we welcomed 15 new members to our community! :tada: We're looking for ideas for new [community initiatives](https://osc-delft.github.io/initiatives) and events - please get in touch (email, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oscdelft) or [GitHub](https://github.com/osc-delft/ideas-and-plans)), I'd love to hear from you. 

If you know of TUD colleagues who'd like to learn more about open science, please ask them to [join us](https://osc-delft.github.io/join) :sunflower: 

**Announcements**
- Congratulations to Mark Schelbergen, PhD Candidate in Data Champion Roland Schmehl's group, for receiving an honorary mention for the National Open Initiatives Trophy!
