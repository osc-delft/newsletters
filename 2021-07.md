**Community Announcements**
- **New community Slack space - [please join us](https://join.slack.com/t/osc-delft/shared_invite/zt-857n65au-tz0kMaLXweiMlwpPPeXR2g)!** We hope to set this up as a welcoming and safe space for our community members to ask open science Qs, exchange views and share opportunities and resources. *We'll also be sending everyone who's not in the Slack group yet a personal invitation!*
- Following dialogue sessions earlier this year, the **TUD Recognition & Reward** committee has shared a Perspective document summarising efforts so far and kicking start actions to modernise the recognition & reward system, in line with open science principles. [Read to find out](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/strategy/recognition-rewards-perspective) how you can continue to help drive change in our academic recognition & reward system!
