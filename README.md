# OSC Delft newsletters

Welcome! This is the GitHub repository where we will put the online versions of the [Open Science Community Delft (OSCD)](https://osc-delft.github.io) newsletters, and hopefully draft them too! 

This newsletter is sent to all OSCD members, once every 2 months. :incoming_envelope:

## How do I sign up to the newsletter?
[Join the Open Science Community Delft!](https://osc-delft.github.io/join) :hibiscus: You have to be employed/studying at TU Delft to be able to receive our newsletter in your inbox- but we welcome everyone interested to read the newsletter online, here in this repo. 

## Roadmap
We still have to upload some of our past newsletters (where possible), and come up with a process to use this GitHub repo to draft newsletters in the future.

## How can I contribute?
You can:
- Let us know if you spot typos in our existing drafts, by opening an [issue](https://github.com/osc-delft/newsletters/issues)
- Check our [list of issues](https://github.com/osc-delft/newsletters/issues) and see if you can help fix some of them!
- Contribute newsletter content, you can do this either by:
  - [Opening an issue](https://github.com/osc-delft/newsletters/issues)(issue template to be added);
  - Directly adding to the Hackmd file of the next draft. To access the Hackmd file:
      1. Switch to the branch named `write-[month]`
      2. There, go to the file `[year]-[month].md` (the year and month being the newsletter you'd like to edit, usually the latest one!)
      3. Click the "Collaborate on HackMD button"
      4. This will open the draft on HackMD, where you can edit/comment on the draft directly
- Direct new members here so they know what they receive in their mailboxes when they become community members! :book:
