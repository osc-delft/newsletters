# OSC Delft newsletters

Welcome! This is the GitHub repository where we will put the online versions of the [Open Science Community Delft (OSCD)](https://osc-delft.github.io) newsletters, and hopefully draft them too! 

This newsletter is sent to all OSCD members, once every 2 months. :incoming_envelope: The newsletter is currently curated and sent by Tanya Yankelevich, OSC Delft coordinator, with contributions from community members.

## How do I sign up to the newsletter?
[Join the Open Science Community Delft!](https://osc-delft.github.io/join) :hibiscus: You have to be employed/studying at TU Delft to be able to receive our newsletter in your inbox- but we welcome everyone interested to read the newsletter online, here in this repo. 

## Scope and Types of items in the newsletters
- Announcements: Open-science related initiatives, publications, presentations, awards, etc that involved OSCD members
- Opportunities: Open-science related funding, job, support opportunities that OSCD members can benefit from
- Events: Institutional, national and international open science events that OSCD members could be interested in participating in.

We limit items to single bullet points - relevant URLs are recommended, (non-excessive) emojis are :ok: , no images allowed.

## How can I contribute?
You can:
- Contribute newsletter content, you can do this either by:
  - Commenting on the [item collection issue](https://github.com/osc-delft/newsletters/issues);
  - Directly adding to the Hackmd file of the next draft. To access the Hackmd file:
      1. Switch to the branch named `write-[month]`
      2. There, go to the file `[year]-[month].md` (the year and month being the newsletter you'd like to edit, usually the latest one!)
      3. Click the "Collaborate on HackMD button"
      4. This will open the draft on HackMD, where you can edit/comment on the draft directly
  - Please refer to the "Scope and types of items in the newsletters" section above for the scope of the newsletter
- Let us know if you spot typos in our existing drafts, by opening an [issue](https://github.com/osc-delft/newsletters/issues)
- Check our [list of issues](https://github.com/osc-delft/newsletters/issues) and see if you can help fix some of them!
- Direct new members here so they know what they receive in their mailboxes when they become community members! :book:

## How do we draft these newsletters?
- Tanya Yankelevich, OSCD coordinator, starts a new branch for the next newsletter (named `write-[month]`, where `month` is whichever month the next newsletter will go out in). This is usually done 2 months ahead of time (as an example, the last newsletter was sent on March 3, 2021; at the same time the new branch for the next newsletter was created - this next newsletter will be sent in the second week of August 2022)
  - She also creates a draft on HackMD, using `newsletter-template.md`. This contains guidelines for all item adders and editors of the newsletter, as well as a deadline for adding items.
  - She creates an items collection issue, which will start with a description of the scope and types of items.
- The HackMD draft is pushed to `write-[month]`, linked to as `[year]-[month].md`
- 1-2 weeks before the newsletter is scheduled to go out, Tanya reminds key stakeholders like the TUD data stewards and open science programme team to add their items to the newsletter, using one fo the two ways laid out above in the "How can I contribute?" section
  - The items added to the item collection issue is copied into the HackMD draft upon review. 
- The day before the newsletter is sent, Tanya reviews all items proposed on the draft and in the relevant issues. 
- The newsletter is sent! The final draft on HackMD is pushed and the writing branch is merged into `main` then deleted. At the same time, a new `write-[month]` branch, items collection issue and HackMD draft is started for the next newsletter.

## Roadmap
We still have to upload some of our past newsletters (where possible).
