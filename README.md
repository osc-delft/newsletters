# OSC Delft newsletters

Welcome! This is the GitHub repository where we will put the online versions of our newsletters, and hopefully draft them too!

## Roadmap
We still have to upload some of our past newsletters (where possible), and come up with a process to use this GitHub repo to draft newsletters in the future.

## How can I contribute?
You can:
- Let us know if you spot typos in our existing drafts, by opening an issue
- Contribute newsletter content- we will have an open issue when we are drafting a next newsletter, and you can add your item(s) by commenting there.
- Direct new members here so they know what they receive in their mailboxes when they become community members! :book:
